            <article>
                <p>Inorder to compare these units let's consider each one by one</p>
                <h3>Pixels</h3>
                <p>Using font-sizes, element sizes and spacing in pixels is like treating the web as there is only one end user which is the developer. In most browsers, a user can set their default browser font-size to be a different size to the default
                    (typically 16px). If the user sets their default to some size by increasing or decreasing it , all font-sizes should scale accordingly. However, if the website explicitly sets font-sizes in pixels, a heading set at the original scale
                    will always be the same. That might sound great from a designer/developer point of view but, it depends on the end user. In these case the users can still zoom in and out to get there preferable view.</p>

                <h3>EM</h3>
                <p>
                    For values given with em, it is equal to the computed size of that element’s parent. To illustrate this, If there is a div element defined with font-size: 16px then for that div and for its children 1em will be computed as 16px. If font-size is not defined
                    explicitly, that element will inherit it from the parent element. The inheritance continues to take place this way amongst ancestors up until the root element. Default font-size of the root element is provided by browser and it is
                    usually 16px. using em will make some trouble by compounding when multiple em-font-sized elements are within one another. This can become a problem and can lead to unintended consequences in the designs.
                </p>
                <h3>REM</h3>
                <p>Values given in rem are relative to the root html element, not to the parent element. That is, If font-size of the root element is 16px then 1 rem = 16px for all elements and if it is 2rem = 32px. If font-size is not explicitly defined
                    in root element then 1rem will be equal to the default font-size provided by the browser which is usually 16px. When it comes to spacing and font-sizing it is preferable to use rem. Since rem uses root element’s font-size instead of
                    its parent’s font-size. unlike em , using rem units allow us to avoid the compounding effect of em units. With rem things are always and consistently based on the font-size or the root element, so there are no surprises no trouble.

                </p>
                <h3>%</h3>
                <p>
                    Using % sor spacifying values, is one of a solution for responsiveness. As mentioned earlier the default font-size of most browsers is 16px. For example setting font-size: 100% will make 1rem = 16px. But a better way is to set font-size: 62.5%. Because
                    62.5% of 16px is 10px. Which makes 1rem = 10px.
